## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"
  href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
